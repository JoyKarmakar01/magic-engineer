# Phase 1: Core Programming and Data Skills

This document outlines the key topics, problems, and mini-projects to solidify your understanding of Python, data manipulation, and visualization. Completing these tasks will build a strong foundation for tackling advanced topics in machine learning and data science.

## Topics and Problems to Solve

### 1. Python Fundamentals
#### Key Concepts:
- Variables, data types, loops, conditionals, functions.
- List comprehensions, dictionaries, and file handling.

#### Problems:
1. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a number.
2. Create a program to check if a given string is a palindrome.
3. Implement a script to read a text file and count the frequency of each word.
4. Write a function to find the largest and smallest numbers in a list.
5. Create a basic calculator program that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. Data Manipulation with Pandas and NumPy
#### Key Concepts:
- DataFrame creation, indexing, filtering, and slicing.
- Aggregations (sum, mean, groupby).
- Missing data handling (fillna, dropna).

#### Problems:
1. Load a CSV file and:
   - Display its shape, column names, and first 5 rows.
   - Filter rows where a specific column has a value greater than 50.
2. Write a script to calculate the mean, median, and mode of a column in a dataset.
3. Merge two DataFrames based on a common column (inner join).
4. Create a new column that is a combination (e.g., sum or difference) of two existing columns.
5. Identify and fill missing values in a dataset using the mean of the column.

### 3. Data Visualization
#### Key Concepts:
- Creating basic plots (line, bar, scatter, histogram).
- Customizing plots (titles, labels, legends, colors).
- Correlation heatmaps.

#### Problems:
1. Plot a histogram showing the distribution of a column in a dataset (e.g., age distribution).
2. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between two variables (e.g., height vs. weight).
3. Build a line chart showing trends over time (e.g., sales across months).
4. Visualize the correlation matrix of a dataset using a heatmap.
5. Create a grouped bar chart comparing two categorical variables.

## Mini-Projects

### Project 1: Sales Data Analyzer
- **Objective**: Analyze sales data to derive insights.
- **Dataset**: A CSV file with columns: `Date`, `Product`, `Sales`, `Region`.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Display the total sales for each region.
  2. Plot a bar chart comparing sales by product.
  3. Filter the top 5 products based on total sales.

### Project 2: Movie Ratings Dashboard
- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize movie ratings.
- **Dataset**: A dataset with columns: `Movie`, `Genre`, `Rating`, `Year`.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Find the highest-rated movie for each genre.
  2. Visualize the average rating of movies by year.
  3. Create a scatterplot of rating vs. year.

### Project 3: Weather Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Explore and visualize weather patterns.
- **Dataset**: A dataset with columns: `Date`, `Temperature`, `Humidity`, `City`.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Calculate the average temperature for each city.
  2. Identify the day with the highest humidity.
  3. Plot a line graph of temperature trends over time for a city.
